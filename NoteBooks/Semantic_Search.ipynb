im left to deal with all these injured people 6 you work where on the ship waste management 7 yeah well not anymore alicia nevins you are now chief life support 8 im doing another eva why 9 to figure out what the hell hit us why else 10 theres some kind of crystal thing wedged in there 11 lane the gloves fingers are nearly off 12 get with angus on the new element hes been analyzing 13 its an early warning system 14 in case we come within range of the element again 15 what will it take to get us back up to near light speed 16 we only have one engine if it blows were dead in the water 17 were just gonna have to push it as far as we can 18 ive seen your medical records 19 theyre too perfect to be real 20 theres something on this ship that you need to know about 21 i will save this ship for one simple reason 22 to save william trust 23 now its your duty to keep trust safe 24 okay who wants to start with department briefs felix 25 i have little to report 26 the crew seems to have settled down into a peaceful routine 27 which frankly makes me nervous 28 dr kabir has med bay seen a similar calm 29 dr kabir 30 yes 31 oh uh yes 32 uh med bay is thankfully empty 33 ive only had a few minor workrelated injuries come in yeah 34 good engineering 35 all good shuttle repairs are complete and neps are up and running at 50 36 oh wait wait 50 37 we wont get to prox b for decades 38 dont worry well run out of fuel way before that 39 i had to eject too much u238 during the meltdown 40 how long do we have why didnt i know 41 relax relax 42 guys alicia and i have already started looking for uranium 238 43 and we will find it right alicia 44 uranium 238 is plentiful in the universe 45 were running a spectral analysis on every chunk of rock we pass en route 46 you know planets planetoids moons 47 so far nothing but im not worried yet 48 if we dont find it soon well run out of fuel 49 sometime in the next two weeks 50 well then lets stop flapping our lips and get back to searching eh 51 okay this meeting is adjourned 52 but before you guys go back 53 angus has a surprise for us in the mess 54 all right well you guys go ahead ill man the bridge 55 let cogner man the bridge 56 angus will want you in the mess hall 57 no one peek under the napkins just take your seats 58 ladies and gentlemen im proud to present 59 coming straight from deck 3r 60 from a long engagement in the worldfamous bioshelter 61 yes things to do places to be get on with it angus 62 right 63 im just trying to bring some humor 64 never mind 65 i present to you all the first small harvest 66 from the bioshelter 67 you may remove your napkins 68 wow this is just the start 69 we have lots more coming 70 apiopensubtitlesorg is deprecated please implement rest api from opensubtitlescom 71 what 72 i want to savor every bite 73 is there a problem with that no not at all 74 oh god i forgot what real food tastes like 75 right 76 right well you take your time savoring alicia 77 some of us have some uranium to search for 78 ill be with you in a few minutes okay 79 oh 80 no no no no no not now 81 not now not now 82 dr kabir i brought you some food 83 this is the first time in weeks ive had even a second 84 to put things where they belong 85 get some semblance of order in this place 86 you missed a special treat in the mess hall 87 angus shared his first harvest i brought you some 88 thank you felix 89 are you okay yes fine 90 you need to eat really 91 they didnt teach us that in medical school 92 im fine just a little stressed 93 havent been able to sleep so go get some sleep now 94 why does everyone keep telling me to get some sleep 95 ill sleep when i feel like it 96 you just said youre stressed because you havent slept 97 theres too much to do there are no patients 98 yeah but some could come ill watch the shop 99 call you when youre needed take the food go 100 now 101 jelena jelena 102 what im trying to sleep 103 did you see who i was with last night 104 get over yourself james 105 i couldnt give a shit who youre sleeping with what no no 106 did you see someone bring me in here 107 i was asleep goodbye 108 shit 109 come on in 110 you wanted me to come by have a seat 111 youre wondering why youre here 112 well i kind of feel like 113 ive been called to the principals office 114 i asked you here because i have the confession 115 you do ive been hiding contraband 116 contraband its against the rules 117 to bring any alcoholic beverages on an ark but 118 i guess captain lester was a rulebreaker 119 found that in her stash well 120 captain lester had a good taste in scotch 121 i wouldnt know 122 im more of a kentucky bourbon girl myself 123 how dare you speak such blasphemy 124 mentioning kentucky swamp juice in the same room 125 as a bottle of glenn verbog 126 i apologize i didnt realize it was a religion to you 127 oh i used to drink this stuff with my old man back in the days of nasa 128 before the whole world started falling apart 129 he was an astronaut really 130 did he ever go anywhere offworld 131 yeah he went to the moonbase a few times 132 he died there 133 when the eastern federation sabotaged it 134 oh spencer im sorry 135 it was a long time ago 136 but it was the reason i signed up for the gsa 137 yeah i wanted to continue what my old man was trying to do 138 save humanity from itself and all that noble crap 139 to noble crap to your father 140 dr hall and i used to drink together too 141 kentucky 142 the whiskey whose name i shall not mention 143 in the same room as glenn watchamacallit 144 dr hall yeah 145 he was the doctor that oversaw the experimentations 146 on me and my sister you must hate him 147 actually he was the closest thing i ever had to a dad 148 i miss him what happened to him 149 died sleeper podbay 1 150 he was on this ark yep 151 i mean hes probably why im on it too 152 though he never admitted to having anything to do with it 153 well to dr hall 154 so i have to ask 155 why i invited you here to have a drink 156 yeah 157 to say thank you 158 ever since you went and revealed all my secrets and called that vote and 159 oh those are two main reasons im surprised you invited me 160 no with hindsight i think it was a good thing 161 now that theres no secrets between us 162 youve become a really good number two 163 so i wanted to say thank you to no secrets between us 164 spencer 165 to no secrets 166 all council members to bridge 167 i wonder what thats about 168 probably brices wellhoned scotch radar going off again 169 oh hello 170 what are you two all smiley about 171 uh why did you call us in here 172 because i am very pleased to say 173 i have found a planet that is rich in uranium238 174 and best of all we dont even have to detour 175 its directly on our route so we just 176 fly down grab it 177 get back up to near light speed 178 only one problem 179 its too far away 180 we dont have enough u238 to get to the u238 181 oh 182 i mean could we open the solar sails 183 no the sails are designed 184 for after we enter the proxima system 185 and they need the solar winds from alpha centauri the star 186 if we could find a closer star would that be any use 187 maybe why 188 cause were about to pass 189 a yellow binary dwarf system 190 if we apply the tisserand parameter 191 to the momentum of the fastest star in the binary 192 it should accelerate us towards the planet where the fuel is 193 ooh and then we can open the sails 194 and gain a multiplier of at least two 195 uh um i have a degree in astrophysics 196 which really explains why they assigned you to waste management 197 wait are you talking about a gravitational slingshot 198 yes its actually quite simple 199 the momentum gravity from the star should act as a catapult 200 and get us going really really fast 201 and then the sails should get us going even faster 202 i think you think 203 um give me a few hours to do some calculations just to be sure 204 well then get on it all right well look while shes doing that 205 im gonna go and check the sails 206 make sure they werent damaged when we were hit 207 im im going to check the remaining fuel 208 cant you do that from here 209 lieutenant brice are you okay 210 yeah why whats up 211 i left the mess hall last night 212 found you passed out in a corridor 213 so youre the one who took me to the crew quarters 214 yes you didnt call for help 215 i didnt want to get you in trouble 216 thought you just needed to sleep it off 217 whered you get the booze booze 218 isnt that why you passed out 219 okay uh firstly im scottish 220 so i dont pass out from booze 221 secondly this really is none of your concern okay 222 oh so i should have taken you to med bay 223 have dr kabir check you 224 now you listen to me very closely 225 as ive just said this is none of your concern 226 and if you tell anybody about this ill make your life on this ship a living hell 227 are we clear 228 if you ever talk to me like that again 229 i will knock out those pretty teeth of yours are you clear 230 oh no no no no no you hang on a second girlie 231 right you dont go sticking your nose 232 in something you donnae got no goddamn idea 233 what youse is talking about right 234 and while were at it 235 hows about having a wee bit of respect for my privacy as well 236 huh i said i didnt understand a thing you just said 237 but i was speaking english were you 238 all right fine 239 what i was trying to say in slightly less polite terms than this 240 was i would like you to respect my effing privacy 241 fine 242 i could have been a bit more respectful about it 243 okay happy thrilled 244 so eva lovely lovely eva 245 would you please do me a favor and keep this to yourself 246 because its embarrassing 247 and quite frankly its nobody elses business but mine 248 i dont know is it contagious 249 how do i know you wont pass out at a time that endangers others 250 its not and i wont 251 give me your word 252 i swear on my mother 253 do you like your mother 254 yes very much 255 then your secret is safe with me 256 thank you 257 so uh 258 do you really think my teeth are pretty then eh 259 you know youve done your required sessions 260 garnets not requiring you to see me anymore 261 yeah well i want to i think i need it 262 oh okay whats bugging you 263 look what i really want to know is 264 can keeping a secret like a big one 265 one you should probably tell someone 266 can holding that in make you sick 267 you mean physically yeah 268 got the runs do you i didnt say that 269 well the answer is yes 270 keeping a big secret can stress you the hell out 271 mess with your stomach cause headaches 272 so whats your big secret 273 well funny thing about secrets is theyre secret 274 fine keep it bottled up inside until you get an ulcer the size of this ship 275 but the best way to prevent that 276 is to share the secret with someone 277 like maybe a doctor 278 everything thats said in here is protected right 279 by some kind of patientdoctor privilege thing 280 yeah unless you tell me that you murdered someone 281 william trust is stashed in a cryopod 282 in a hidden room on this ship 283 cat 284 cat 285 william trust 286 like the will trust who invented this effing ship that we live on 287 that will trust yeah 288 is he with anyone yeah a woman 289 you know youre right i do feel much better now that ive let that out 290 maybe i should just go tell garnet too 291 no you cant tell anyone else how is he in ark 1 why 292 all i know is that he was being protected by trent 293 and a bunch of other people who died in the accident 294 and now its fallen on me to protect him 295 although i dont know from who 296 ill tell you from who half the people on this ship 297 a lot of people lost loved ones because of trust 298 right but were alive on this ship because of him 299 i know im just telling you ive heard it in many sessions 300 there are people who genuinely hate the man 301 maybe to the point where they would even kill him 302 well how about you doc 303 how do you feel about him me 304 i could take him or leave him why 305 well because if you were in the want to kill him camp we would have a problem 306 oh i want him very much alive 307 you have no idea 308 how about garnet 309 do you think shes in the want to kill him camp 310 i dont know 311 but i dont know that shes not in that camp either 312 so you cant tell her 313 you cant tell anyone else 314 is it true you picked ark 5 for your own departure 315 because youre afraid the earlier arks 316 wont make it to their destinations 317 what kind of asinine question is that 318 i invented those arks and i would trust them 319 with my life you twobit ass of a 320 what my husband is trying to say 321 is he designed the earlier ships to go to closer planets 322 so before we go william wants to stay behind 323 to perfect the faster than light speed engine 324 its the only way to ensure that all the arks can make it to their destinations 325 which are much further away than proxima b or ross 128b 326 hopefully hell accomplish it in time to go on ark 5 327 so you were supposed to be on ark 5 328 then why are you here 329 they went two by two into the ark 330 eva and i ran the numbers and did a computer simulation were sure itll work 331 if brice can pilot the ark exactly to my specifications not a problem 332 you sure you can keep it in my parameters 333 are you sure theyre the correct parameters 334 oh my parameters are always perfect 335 well then i will fit within them perfectly 336 good uh okay 337 um so lieutenant brice will pilot us 338 on a specific trajectory around the dwarf star 339 the momentum from the orbital gravity of the star 340 will whip us around and project us 341 toward our target planet and double our speed 342 but the trajectory has to be within two degrees of accuracy 343 it will be 344 good because if cut it too tight 345 then we wont achieve escape velocity 346 from the stars gravity 347 we could be pulled into the star and burn up 348 exactly and too wide then we wont gain enough speed 349 to get to where we want to go 350 so assuming this all goes perfectly 351 then we open the solar sails yes 352 and were sure its enough to get us 353 to the planet with all the fuel 354 more than enough thoughts 355 well i think we should do it 356 dr kabir we have a problem 357 someone got into the drug cabinet 358 and stole most of the drugs again 359 they werent stolen i took them 360 what 361 youre done with the pills doctor 362 what are you talking about 363 i worked in law enforcement most of my adult life 364 i know a drug problem when i see one 365 how dare you i am a doctor 366 i know better than anyone 367 what narcotics can do to a person 368 we both know im not talking about narcotics 369 im talking about amphetamines whatever 370 i know what they do to a person if abused 371 how stupid do you think i am 372 do you think i would compromise myself like that 373 do you really think so little of me 374 are you done yelling at me 375 hmm notice im here alone 376 im giving you this chance to beat your addiction 377 if you do that and i will help you 378 this will stay between the two of us 379 i didnt mean for it to get out of hand 380 but all the other doctors are dead and im the only one left 381 so i started taking them to stay awake 382 so i could help my patients 383 i know 384 but it did get out of hand 385 i guess so 386 what happens when i crash from withdrawal 387 i have to be on call at all times 388 there are no other doctors who will tend the patients 389 i will thats nice felix 390 look i know you have field medic training 391 but what if the patient or patients come in with something beyond that 392 forgive me rudimentary training they wont 393 were in a period of calm right now 394 but if something does come in that i cant handle 395 ill call you and youll walk me through it 396 okay 397 okay 398 initializing sun protection now 399 attention all personnel brace for acceleration 400 everyone take a seat or grab ahold of something 401 window opens in three two one 402 you hit the marks perfectly lieutenant brice 403 was it ever in any doubt ready to open sails now 404 whoo come on good going everyone 405 i dont want to jinx it but that couldnt have gone more perfectly 406 uh you jinxed it whats happened 407 the star just threw off a massive solar flare 408 it tore a section of the aft starboard sail 409 any other damage no 410 but we cant pull out of the stars gravity without all of the sails 411 meaning meaning well be shot back 412 towards the damn star and burn up 413 unless we think of something very fast 414 its getting frigging hot in here 415 were getting too close to that star 416 ive tried to reroute more energy to climate control 417 but its already pushed to the limit 418 the heat will be the least of our problems 419 if we dont fix the sail in the next twenty minutes 420 how do we do that usually i would do a spacewalk 421 and make the repair it would only take a few slavinsky clamps 422 but were too close the solar radiation would fry anyone who goes out there 423 exactly but someone has to great 424 so our best hope is asking someone to do another suicide mission 425 ill do it 426 what is it with you and your death wish buddy 427 its an not a death wish 428 there is someone who may be able to do it 429 without it being a suicide 430 me 431 one of my tardigrade dna strands 432 is to withstand more solar radiation than any of you 433 but youd be exposed to at least twice 434 what an average human can handle 435 how much can you take i dont know it was never tested 436 dr hall was afraid it would kill me if it didnt work 437 and what if your changes dont protect you youll die 438 if i dont try we all die 439 this is garnet headed for airlock 5 440 have a suit and helmet ready for an immediate eva 441 108 fahrenheit and rising in here 42 degrees celsius 442 ive arrived at mast a12 443 climbing out to the damaged sail 444 keep yourself tethered 445 thats rich coming from mister i know what im doing here 446 just be careful how you feeling radiationwise i mean 447 skins feeling like a bad sunburn tolerable so far 448 approaching the damage 449 okay 450 now pull the folded piece from the base of the fold 451 careful not to damage any of the cells 452 now use your slavinsky clamps to reattach the sail 453 to the mast hold 32b and 32c 454 done 455 okay im going to trim it from here 456 hold on tight 457 garnet 458 garnet are you okay 459 not really coming back in 460 ill meet you at the airlock 461 garnet is in the airlock outer door is sealed 462 garnet garnet 463 garnet she has a pulse 464 help me get her to the med bay 465 thrust is approaching breakaway 466 everyone brace 467 five four three two one 468 breakaway achieved 469 accelerating we just doubled our velocity 470 still accelerating 471 tapering off at 38 times our original speed 472 better than i thought wed do 473 so that means well make it to the planet 474 that it does alicia 475 oh darn oh darn 476 um remember that sensor algorithm that angus and i came up with 477 to detect the substance that burnt the ship yes yes what about it 478 it just detected loads of it 479 on the planet were headed towards 480 wait so youre saying 481 we might be jumping out of the frying pan 482 and straight into the fire 483 wheres dr kabir 484 indisposed what where is she get her 485 help me get her out of this pressure suit i wont ask you again 486 where is dr kabir i am perfectly capable 487 of dressing these burns and running iv for fluids 488 thats all that can be done for her at this time 489 what are you not telling me what i am telling you 490 lieutenant is that you need to go back on that bridge 491 and figure out our next move 492 youre in charge now ive got this 493 she better not die she will not 494 i will notify you when she awakens 495 where do we stand now 496 um the planet that were barreling towards 497 is full of the substance that dissolved parts of this ship 498 when angus analyzed it he thought it could be a weapon 499 from who were the only people out this far 500 little green men 501 more likely just a natural deposit 502 i think we should change course just to be safe 503 we need the uranium or were dead in space 504 well find it somewhere else and if we dont we die 505 well acting captain what do you suggest we do 506 uh i dont know 507 what do you think ive just told you 508 i think we should change course 509 do we have some kind of probe that we could send ahead 510 no can the sensors give us any other clue 511 about what were flying into no 512 what we need is an advance scout 513 but we dont have one of those either 514 yes we do the shuttle right 515 i could fly ahead recon the situation 516 before the arks anywhere near the danger zone 517 but the shuttle cant fly faster than the ark actually it can 518 since it will start already at the speed were traveling 519 the shuttles boosters can only add speed in the vacuum of space 520 they should take it well ahead of ark one 521 brice that substance can melt the entire shuttle with you in it 522 yeah well shuttles got more chance of evading notice than this great big ship 523 you know what lieutenant garnet would say 524 honestly i dont really care mate 525 youre in charge now she would say we cant risk our only navigator 526 yeah ah but ive been training up cogner 527 she can navigate isnt that right cogner 528 not really youve barely taught me anything 529 oh that maybe i should take the shuttle 530 im a pilot look im not being funny 531 lane but youre not quite the pilot i am 532 theyd shoot you out of space before youd remember which yoke controller to pull 533 i am expendable no more than anyone else man 534 right im gonna prep the shuttle then ill go too to assist 535 no no you wont well lose the navigator 536 and best engineer its fine eva really 537 im not risking two key people theres a very good chance 538 he wont make it halfway to the target why not 539 because im not 100 sure 540 about the repairs we made to the shuttle 541 he might need me there to keep it running 542 ill manage thank you 543 then i wont clear the shuttle for the flight 544 you already have i dont care 545 ill announce to the whole crew 546 that you took a broken shuttle and why 547 ill tell them everything about you 548 what is she talking about brice 549 i dont know that im taking too many risks maybe 550 well shes not wrong well then maybe she should come 551 i didnt say that we need our engineer 552 sasha is as good as i am 553 lets go eva 554 so this is what its like being in charge 555 shouldnt we put on our suits you feel free 556 i dont intend on needing it 557 shuttle prepared for departure 558 you have a go be careful 559 i always am never are 560 you know i i think i know why you insisted on coming with me 561 im sure you do its because you just cant get enough of me isnt it 562 oh yeah thats exactly why 563 i didnt want our only shuttle to crash 564 because you passed out at the wheel 565 im not gonna pass out good 566 oh and why the way it uses a yoke 567 there is no wheel 568 it was a figure of speech genius 569 why dont you just tell me what you have wrong with you 570 um no why not 571 im already keeping your secret anyway 572 without even knowing what it is how fast do you reckon 573 i can push this baby because i would really like 574 to shorten this conversation 575 i wouldnt push it any more than that 576 oh very funny 577 shit 578 good you have a pulse 579 come on wake up 580 i cant pilot this hunk of metal alone wake up 581 shuttle whats your progress 582 all is well were approaching the target 583 hey brice send me the approach vectors 584 lieutenant brice hes hes in the toilet 585 hell respond in a second minute 586 come on come on wake up wake up wake up 587 wake up dummy wake up 588 you love me you want to kiss 589 aah ow 590 not gonna pass out huh ah 591 it was a damn good thing that i was here 592 yeah i i wouldve woken up anyway 593 maybe in a few days 594 ark one wants the approach vectors 595 right 596 um we are approaching the target 597 the vector is 5330 598 hey brice next time 599 go to the toilet before you leave 600 yeah uh sorry about that mate 601 um blame angus man 602 those veggies went right through me 603 brice out 604 you told them i went to the toilet on a recon mission 605 what should i have told them that you passed out at the yoke 606 fair point 607 thank you for you know keeping it quiet 608 i wont continue to do so if you dont tell me whats going on 609 eva its private okay 610 ark one theres something you should 611 all right all right fine 612 i have klampkins disease 613 its a terminal i know what it is 614 i knew people who died from it 615 there is no cure 616 no 617 its from all that crap that trust put in the atmosphere 618 trying to save the planet 619 just ended up poisoning people like me 620 do you mind me asking how long do you have 621 nobody knows 622 it kills some people in weeks others in years 623 do these passing out episodes mean its getting worse 624 um no 625 no it comes in clusters you know 626 then it goes away again then it comes back 627 the last cluster was um 628 it was about a year before the ark launched 629 this explains so much 630 like why you have a goddamn death wish 631 yeah i guess 632 i mean im gonna die anyway right 633 look um nobody knows on the ark 634 not even dr kabir not exactly no 635 she might be able to help you look eva please please 636 theres nothing she can do all right 637 and to be perfectly honest i dont 638 i dont really want to be treated like some fragile patient 639 for whatever remains of my life you know 640 id like to accomplish something 641 id like to maybe be instrumental in creating a new world for humanity 642 who knows 643 otherwise what was my life even for 644 can you understand that yes 645 so you wont 646 you wont tell anybody 647 wheres dr kabir good to see you awake lieutenant garnet 648 im caring for

me in 686 were approaching the planet 687 brice took the shuttle ahead 688 brice and eva you were out 689 i had to make decisions angus and my sensor 690 it detected a whole bunch of the stuff that damaged our ship 691 we had to find out if it was safe to approach the planet so 692 so you sent brice ahead 693 smart move i wouldve done the same 694 wouldnt have sent eva but i mean what can you do 695 this is tiny even for a dwarf planet 696 this doesnt make any sense 697 ive scanned the whole surface 698 were not detecting either element 699 no u238 or the destructive stuff 700 did you check the equipment 701 is that sharon garnet i hear glad youre alive sister 702 glad to be alive welcome back lieutenant 703 to answer your question i ran the scanner check its working fine 704 it detects every other element 705 but not u238 or the acid stuff 706 we really have to come up with a name for that stuff 707 how about aliciaminium or not 708 the scanners can only scan line of sight surfaces 709 could it be on the other side of the planetoid 710 hey brice swing around and check roger that 711 oh shit sranje 712 sorry i didnt get that please repeat 713 um well you guys arent going to

someones watching us 278 you think any chance we could trace the signal 279 chances are its encrypted 280 cellphone ringing buzzing 281 282 you think i should answer it 283 here 284 hello 285 what took you so long 286 i was getting so bored waiting for you 287 to follow all of my bread crumbs 288 this is special agent simone clark 289 who are you 290 wrong question who are they 291 the undercover agents on the list 292 not just their names 293 their operations 294 the groups theyve infiltrated 295 one phone call from me and bodies start dropping 296 okay you obviously have some demands 297 no just one im not greedy 298 release prisoner number 43602 299 from your federal correctional institution in terminal island 300 or i will release the real name of one of your undercover agents 301 every day at 1000 a m starting today 302 its a little after 1000 now 303 yes but as i said i was growing impatient 304 so i released one already 305 sent a text to someone who wasnt too pleased to learn 306 that theres an fbi agent in their midst 307 give us the name 308 now wheres the fun in that 309 once you find their body 310 youll understand how serious i am 311 alright uh we want to work with you 312 but you gotta give to get 313 tell us the name of the undercover agent you exposed 314 and then lets talk 315 prisoner 43602 316 release him or get used to burying your dead 317 cellphone beeps 318 319 buzzer 320 chiles who the hell is he 321 no idea five weeks ago 322 prisoner 43602 walked into a federal courthouse 323 punched out a random bailiff 324 then he got on his knees and put his hands over his head 325 oh he wanted to get arrested 326 yeah but neither his fingerprints 327 nor his dna are in the system 328 he came in as a john doe 329 the only identifying thing about him are those tattoos 330 which appear to be of colombian origin 331 whats he got to say for himself 332 not a damn thing 333 hasnt spoken one word since hes been in custody 334 cyber unit determined which list 335 the hackers initially stole off our database 336 there are over 1800 fbi undercovers 337 operating nationwide but we got lucky 338 theres only 214 names on the sublist that was hacked 339 all in the western territory 340 we got to take those agents out of the field 341 no its not that simple undercovers arent planets 342 theyre suns 343 any abrupt extraction would endanger 344 everyone in their orbit 345 who they vouched for whoever vouched for them 346 theyre all as good as dead as soon as an undercover is made 347 gideon well the buffets open tomorrow night 348 were bagging pills snort and smoke 349 just got the word from my new source 350 what youre gonna trust a new source 351 talk about dogcrap ideas laughs 352 no one asked you 353 hey 354 back off 355 a handler will send a coded warning 356 if theres a risk of exposure something benign 357 that only the handler and an undercover knows 358 cellphone buzzing 359 360 laura but undercovers work cases for months sometimes years 361 investing countless hours building relationships 362 finding sources gaining trust 363 so its gonna take more than just one warning 364 to convince an undercover to end an op 365 theyll want confirmation that everyone left behind is safe 366 so youre telling me if you were undercover 367 and you thought you were exposed youd just ignore it 368 until i got everyone in my orbit out safe yeah 369 and most undercovers will risk their lives to do the same 370 and laura brendon mobilize agents to start alerting uces 371 carter simone find out who the hell our mystery prisoner is 372 hey look i know youre the boss now 373 i know you have more experience with teens in crisis 374 you take point 375 im simone 376 who are you sweetie hmm 377 i see the scars

dangerous 781 so is the death penalty 782 and thats what youre gonna be facing if you dont help us 783 whats his name 784 buzzer 785 good morning raul 786 door closes 787 thats right sweet thing 788 we know exactly who you are 789 were dope like that 790 more importantly we know who your brother is 791 cesar almunia 792 former officer in colombias 793 national intelligence directorate 794 he got fed up with the government 795 switched sides and founded the mnf paramilitary group 796 your brother is known as the butcher of bogot 797 but you looked up to him 798 and shortly after he started the mnf you joined 799 you know nothing 800 i know you wanted to escape the violence 801 didnt you 802 raul we filed an application for emergency amnesty 803 we are going to keep you safe 804 wwhy would you help me 805 because somebody has to 806 and just like were helping you you can help people too 807 tell us what this is all about 808 my brother 809 he he sent me here to negotiate a weapons deal 810 10 million for hundreds of rpgs and small arms 811 enough to ensure the conflict back home 812 continues for a decade 813 i was the only one he trusted 814 but you didnt go through with it 815 more orphans will not make our country stronger 816 the payment was going to be through a cryptocurrency 817 so i made a new account 818 only i know the password 819 so the only way your brother can get that money 820 is to get to you 821 there was nowhere i could go where he wouldnt find me 822 and if he did torture pain beyond imagination 823 so you went to the safest place you can think of 824 federal prison 825 but he found me even here 826 i guess his contacts at the intelligence services paid off 827 carter i have a crazy idea 828 how crazy 829 you want to stop the violence the killing 830 yeah 831 raul i need you to trust us 832 chiles your plan is what now 833 raul gave us the password to his cryptocurrency account 834 this is what cesar really wants 835 cellphone ringing buzzing

841 tracy its either that or another one of our own dies 842 and its not really walking away 843 he still has to buy weapons 844 and raul gave us the name of the arms dealer 845 he was gonna meet with 846 and brendon and laura are working on tracing him 847 and have they not yet but 848 great 849 carter this is quite the position youve put me in 850 cellphone beeps 851 this is special agent in charge tracy chiles 852 you did not release prisoner 43602 853 uh no but we do have a series of numbers 854 that he said would be important to you 855 we could give them to you if you agree to stop

the butt 915 so its okay 916 these are for kicking ass and looking fly 917 its crazy though 918 weve been feds less than three months 919 and this is the second funeral for a fallen agent 920 at least the bureau does it right you know classy 921 but when them bagpipes start 922 oh my god 923 the waterworks laughing yeah 924 jason wont uh have a formal funeral 925 itll be small and quiet 926 why 927 cause he was killed while undercover 928 they dont have parades no fanfare 929 secrecy of the op comes first 930 yeah but his cover was already blown 931 i mean its its out there 932 it doesnt matter 933 theres still plenty of assets he came in contact with 934 that need protecting 935 other ongoing operations that he was connected to 936 with principals who may not know the truth 937 yeah but

well looks like im gonna have to tell you 259 theyre just left on my doorstep 260 nobody ever come around to collect money for it 261 and hey how could i pass a bargain like that eh 262 you expect us to believe that 263 i already told you i didnt expect you 264 to believe it didnt i 265 you know if you told us the truth 266 you might get off with just going back 267 to the penitentiary penitentiary 268 no no jim not the penitentiary 269 not that why not 270 i thought you said all your old friends were there 271 itd be like going back home 272 well last time i was paroled 273 they wanted me to help them make 274 a break after i got out 275 they forced me to take money 276 to make arrangements with 277 after i got out i realized 278 what they wanted me to do wasnt legal 279 where were you the day ed was shot 280 well i was out of town 281 i was over at tyler junction 282 how did you know what day ed was shot 283 i was over there whole week 284 can you prove it 285 well ask anybody 286 ask anybody in tyler junction 287 just ask them ill do that 288 well telegraph the town marshal 289 dont try to leave town 290 where would i go 291 my duty is to stay here helping people 292 pulling teeth 293 jim he wasnt in tyler junction 294 marshal ran him out of town a year ago 295 hasnt seen him since 296 wanna come with me while i make the arrest 297 joe hey sheriff hey joe 298 you looking for doc dawson yes 299 got himself a rig hightailed it out of town 300 headed north 301 well if there was any doubt 302 let me bring him in sheriff 303 here 304 whoa 305 thought id take a little drive 306 fresh air sorta clears my head 307 youre under arrest 308 you know that dont you 309 yeah i was afraid youd say that 310 get in 311 i didnt have no choice 312 i had to run 313 hanging or penitentiary 314 nobodyll believe me 315 you dont give anybody a chance 316 why dont you tell the truth once in a while 317 i am first time in my life ever tried it 318 doesnt work shouldve made up a good lie 319 well the next thing im gonna be wanting from you 320 is a confession and no lying 321 now jim you know me 322 do you believe id murder somebody 323 unless it was absolutely necessary 324 no not for no dental chair 325 you know my record 326 oh you bet i do 327 larceny embezzlement 328 theft blackmail 329 yeah but no murder 330 now that dental stuff was left on my doorstep 331 just like i told you 332 i dont know how it got there 333 somebodys trying to frame me 334 well if itd been me 335 i wouldve taken all that stuff 336 everything i could get my hands on 337 yeah i know you would 338 thats the part that puzzles me 339 why just the dental chair was taken 340 why was ed killed 341 unless somebody was wanting to murder him 342 and blame it on the robbery 343 thats what im getting at 344 they hauled that dental chair to me 345 so as i would be blamed 346 well thats worth checking into 347 when we get back to town 348 youll wait for me in your office 349 im gonna go have a talk with the sheriff 350 hyah hyah 351 theres something likeable about the old coot 352 despite the way he carries on 353 but i think youre stretching things hardie 354 hes as guilty as they come 355 whod have reason to kill ed matton 356 nobody in town 357 ed never harmed a soul 358 never had an argument with anyone 359 well it didnt amount to much 360 he never got along too well 361 with his brotherinlaw clyde 362 why not 363 well clyde was left the same amount of money 364 as sarah when their father died 365 he moved to new orleans and came back broke 366 heard later he lost most of it gambling 367 why would that cause trouble between he and ed 368 well sarah was giving him money after that 369 and ed put a stop to it 370 said clyde would never settle down 371 if she kept it up 372 what about this joe haynes 373 is there anything there 374 oh hes been their best friend for years 375 always around their place 376 wasnt that way at first though 377 he thought he was gonna be the lucky one 378 did he ever get married 379 no 380 and rich widows usually marry pretty fast 381 and to someone theyve known 382 were ed and sarah happy 383 well that i know 384 she wanted to set ed up in business here in the town 385 didnt want him to work so hard 386 but you cant change ed 387 he preferred working for wells fargo 388 ever had any trouble over that 389 no trouble 390 argued about it sometimes 391 joe haynes was handy in case anything happened 392 you know once you take murder 393 as a motive for that hijacking 394 all of a sudden you got three suspects 395 is there anybody else 396 id be afraid to mention anybody else 397 youd prove the whole town guilty 398 well i might try 399 you know if you can hold off 400 on arresting dawson for the rest of the day 401 ive got something id like to try 402 that might just work 403 all right 404 see you pretty soon 405 i thought you finally trusted me jim 406 doing this to an old friend 407 well i do i just didnt want you 408 to be tempted to clear your head 409 with any of that fresh air again 410 i couldve left anytime i wanted to 411 man of my word 412 why didnt you pick this one too 413 never trust a dentist 414 a man can pick locks with them gadgets 415 i think i can clear you dawson 416 but im gonna need your help 417 ill do anything you want 418 im gonna try to trap the killer 419 who is it jim i dont know yet 420 id trap beaver if i knew where any were 421 you used to be one of the biggest 422 outlaws in this country 423 its real nice of you to say that jim 424 jim you were tough shrewd and clever 425 got any of that left in you 426 are you asking me as my parole officer or my friend 427 as your friend 428 havent lost a bit of it 429 tough as steel 430 smarter 431 well youre gonna have to be 432 because youre gonna be the bait for a trap 433 bait 434 the way ive got it figured 435 i think i can get the man 436 who killed ed matton 437 to try to kill you too 438 i never was one to mince words 439 i need 500 by tonight 440 leave town if i get it 441 otherwise to protect myself 442 ill tell the sheriff who killed ed matton 443 otherwise to protect myself 444 id have to tell the sheriff 445 about ed mattons murderer 446 i was awake that night 447 saw the dental supplies delivered 448 saw who delivered them 449 i was never one to mince words 450 i need 500 by tonight 451 leave town if i get it 452 otherwise to protect myself 453 ill have to tell the sheriff 454 about ed mattons murderer 455 i was awake that night 456 saw the dental supplies delivered 457 saw who delivered them 458 we talked over your offer 459 i cant figure out 460 whether you saw anything or not 461 dont make any difference now 462 whyd you talk alone to us 463 if you saw both of us 464 didnt wanna tip off the law 465 did you bring the money 466 why didnt the sheriff arrest you 467 i told hardie the truth 468 the equipment was left on my doorstep 469 didnt know anything about the murder 470 and he believed you 471 yeah yeah i got to go 472 if hardie believed him 473 maybe a court of law would 474 but if this old man hung himself 475 out of remorse for killing ed matton 476 and stealing all of that freight 477 wouldnt be a jury in the world 478 wouldnt say he was guilty 479 hang myself 480 hardie can say all he wants 481 but under circumstances like these 482 when a man commits suicide 483 yeah but i aint 484 help mr dawson hang himself 485 the only way we can stay in the clear 486 you can keep the money 487 ill leave town anyway 488 jim hold it right there 489 we got two birds with one rock 490 had it all worked out between you didnt you 491 haynes would marry sarah 492 and clyde would get his allowance again 493 turn around slow 494 what happened to his gold tooth 495 huh where 496 oh i guess he lost it in the fight 497 itll be around here somewhere 498 you aint never gonna change 499 do you have to do it jim 500 im afraid i do 501 well maybe youve earned 502 a right to it i dont know 503 then why are you taking it away 504 two reasons 505 one its stolen property 506 and two you havent got a license 507 to practice dentistry 508 well 509 till i get my memoirs in order 510 i guess ill just have to find myself 511 a new profession you be careful 512 what that new profession is 513 well ill be careful jim nothing underhanded 514 getting too old for that sort of thing 515 its going to be honest upright 516 ill bet 517 what are you looking so worried about 518 that man acts like he thinks im a liar 518 please rate this subtitle at wwwosdblinkc65ds
